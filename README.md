# Isonews - Dummy News Page

This project contains a dummy news page designed to be used as a prop for a short film. It is a single-page HTML application, styled with Tailwind CSS, and includes some custom CSS for specific visual effects like a breaking news ticker and rain overlay.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main and only file, containing the entire structure, content, and styling for the dummy news page.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the page structure and content.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **Custom CSS**: For animations (e.g., breaking news ticker, rain effect) and specific styling adjustments.
- **JavaScript**: A small script is included for mobile menu toggling.

## Purpose

This page is intended to serve as a visual prop for a short film, simulating a news website with fictional headlines and articles. It is not a functional news site and does not involve any backend or dynamic content generation.
